What is it?
===========

This plugin enables the embedding of arbitrary application windows into the Xfce
panel. The window is resized into the panel space available, and the associated
program can be automatically launched if it is not open.

Example uses include embedding an instant messaging buddy list, a mail client's
new mail ticker, a simple media application, or a fancy clock or timer.
Combining with Xfce's ability to auto-hide panels can make this very convenient.
